             This Head set whose options list includes a covering package, that stretches the ITEL’s ear comforters by 18cm , and adds more metal to the rear covers. The grille is a serious statement that takes its cue from 2016’s <br>
             magnificently in-yer-face Vision 6 concept, and the C-pillars feature fixed quarterlights with an illuminated brand logo on the outside. They’ve pushed the ITEL-based design envelope a fair bit harder than they did on the previous ones, but essentially this is an ultra-luxe set.
